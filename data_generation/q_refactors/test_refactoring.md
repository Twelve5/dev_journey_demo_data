# Test Refactoring Summary

The test suite has been refactored to improve maintainability and readability while maintaining comprehensive test coverage. Key improvements include:

1. **Logical Test Organization**
   - Tests are now grouped into focused test classes based on functionality
   - Each test class has a clear, single responsibility
   - Setup code is properly isolated in setUp methods

2. **Improved Test Naming and Documentation**
   - Test names clearly describe what is being tested
   - Docstrings added to provide additional context
   - Test classes have clear descriptions of their purpose

3. **Reduced Test Complexity**
   - Complex tests with multiple assertions split into smaller, focused tests
   - Parameterized tests using subTest for better organization of multiple test cases
   - Simplified setup and reduced duplication

4. **Better Mock Usage**
   - Mock objects are created in setUp methods when used multiple times
   - Clear separation between mocked dependencies and the system under test
   - Improved readability of test expectations

5. **Key Changes by File**

   a. test_data_generator.py:
   - Split into basic, dataset, and entity-specific test classes
   - Simplified complex dataset generation test
   - Added more focused validation tests
   
   b. test_operation_service.py:
   - Separated basic functionality from validation tests
   - Improved organization of input validation cases
   - Simplified operation generation test
   
   c. test_product_data_service.py:
   - Created separate test classes for setup, products, and rates
   - Improved edge case testing with subTest
   - Better organization of test data setup
