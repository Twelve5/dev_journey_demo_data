# Code Organization Refactoring

The code in the make_data folder has been reorganized into three subdirectories to improve modularity and maintainability:

## Operations
Files related to operation generation and validation:
- operation_service.py: Core service for generating operations
- operation_generator.py: Generator with validation
- operation_constraints.py: Validation rules and constraints

## Geometry  
Files for handling geometric operations:
- geometry_utils.py: Utility functions for geometry manipulation
- geometry_constraints.py: Constraints and validation for geometries

## Crops
Files for crop-related functionality:
- crops.py: Core crop constants and utilities
- crop_constraints.py: Crop validation rules

Each subdirectory has an __init__.py that exposes the public interface for that module. This organization:

1. Groups related functionality together
2. Makes dependencies between modules clearer
3. Provides better encapsulation of implementation details
4. Makes the codebase more maintainable and testable

The data_generator.py file has been updated to use the new module structure.
