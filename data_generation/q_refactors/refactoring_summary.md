# Data Generator Refactoring Summary

The data generation code has been refactored to improve maintainability and testability. Key changes include:

## Architectural Changes

1. **Separated Generator Classes**:
   - Created specialized generator classes for each entity type
   - Each generator handles its own validation and constraints
   - Generators maintain their own collections of generated entities

2. **Class Structure**:
   - BusinessGenerator - Handles business entity generation
   - FarmGenerator - Handles farm entity generation
   - FieldGenerator - Handles field entity generation with geometry constraints
   - CropZoneGenerator - Handles crop zone generation with seasonal constraints 
   - OperationGenerator - Handles operation generation with product/timing constraints

3. **DataGenerator Class Changes**:
   - Now acts as an orchestrator
   - Delegates all generation to specialized generators
   - Uses property accessors to provide access to generated entities
   - Simplified error handling by delegating to generators

## Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**:
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Each generator focuses on one entity type
   - Validation logic kept with relevant generation code

2. **Better Testing**:
   - Generators can be tested in isolation
   - Mocking dependencies is easier
   - Test data generation more focused

3. **Enhanced Flexibility**:
   - Generator implementations can be swapped
   - Constraints can be modified per generator
   - New generators can be added without modifying others

## Usage

The DataGenerator class usage remains the same, but internally it now delegates to specialized generators:

```python
generator = DataGenerator(product_service)

# Generate entities using specialized generators
business = generator.generate_business()
farm = generator.generate_farm(business)
field = generator.generate_field(farm)
crop_zones = generator.generate_crop_zones_for_field(field)
operation = generator.generate_operation(crop_zone, field, farm, business)

# Access generated entities through properties
all_businesses = generator.businesses
all_farms = generator.farms
all_fields = generator.fields
all_crop_zones = generator.crop_zones
all_operations = generator.operations
```
